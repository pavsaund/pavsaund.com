Yesterday, <a title="Einar Ingebrigtsen" href="http://twitter.com/einari">Einar Ingebrigtsen</a> and I had a co-talk at NNUG Vestfold, titled:  "<a href="http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Vestfold/Moter/NNUG-Vestfold---22-Februar-2012/">Sugarcoating your front-end, one ViewModel at a time</a>".

We had a great turn-up and a good Q&amp;A thereafter. I think we got a few people to star thinking slightly differently in regards to how to treat web-pages more like web-apps. We pushed hard on the MVVM pattern and how that conceptually fits the way web, and web-apps work. KnockoutJS certainly is a framework I'm starting to really love, and I'm sure there are other out there ready for it. We also emphasized the need for well-tested JavaScript testing of your code, and everything that's involved. JavaScript is still code! :)

It's really a jungle out there, and there's no lack of frameworks and solutions. There is one thing for sure though, and this is valid for all frameworks, they all focus on enabling Single Page Applications, and users are starting to expect that exact functionality.
