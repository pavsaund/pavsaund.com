title: My road to becoming a better developer

Though I'm a developer by profession, I don't have the opportunity to get my hands dirty with code on a regular basis. Don't get me wrong, i love my job, but i feel that it's time to step up and move on.

Unlike hardcore programmers, I haven't dedicated myself to coding when i really had time for it. I only starting programming seriously after i finished college, which meant wife + kid + family + other random activities. It's all a matter of priority though, isn't it? I don't regret on my priorities, my family will always come first..it's just the way I am. But it's time for me to structurize myself and push myself to be the best (programmer) i can be.

I hope that making this blog will help me achieving this, and so far I must say I feel I'm on the right track.
