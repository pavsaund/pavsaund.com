<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not interested in being average. I’m out to be exceptional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not waiting to be picked. I’m actively creating opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m commanding my time so I can own my trajectory and maximize my impact.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align:right;">  <a href="http://www.outlierdeveloper.com/manifesto/">The Outlier Developer Manifesto</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><!--more-->I signed the manifesto after watching Cory House's brilliant pluralsight course "<span class="s1"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/career-reboot-for-developer-mind/table-of-contents">Becoming an Outlier: Reprogramming the Developer Mind</a>".</span></p>
<p class="p1">I don't see my work as a job or a career, but a calling. Second only to my family. I summed this up in my work motivation, the way I see it now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Simplify lives of users by creating software solutions that solves real needs. Preferrably with <span class="s1">a highly skilled team of like-minded, caring individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Oh, and make a dent in the universe on the way...</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align:left;">No lofty goals there... But this is my guiding star. So I'm <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit2.php">beginning with the end in mind</a>. Mind you, this is not a New Years resolution, but a long term mission statement.</p>

<h2 class="p1" style="text-align:left;">Areas of focus <del>Next Steps</del></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align:left;">As for the reaching towards that goal, I've decided upon upon which areas that will need attention. Based on these I can define my next steps.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="p1">Continue my community work as Chapter Lead for the local .Net user group (<a href="http://vestfold.nnug.no">NNUG Vestfold</a>).</li>
	<li class="p1">Build and contribute to the new <a href="http://bit.ly/vestfolddevelopersjoinslack">Vestfold Developer slack community</a> for all developers in and around the Vestfold area. Contribute to making others succeed.</li>
	<li class="p1">Take my CSS skills to the next level so I can deliver a true end-to-end experience for users.</li>
	<li class="p1">Actively learn new front-end technology(ies) that I don't use at work.</li>
	<li class="p1">Speak at another user group outside of Vestfold, and possibly also a conference.</li>
	<li class="p1">Answering closed questions with thoughts on my blog.</li>
	<li class="p1">Continue to embrace team leadership, Agile, architecture and share my thoughts around this.</li>
	<li class="p1">Create urgency by setting concrete goals.</li>
	<li class="p1">Do it all in public.</li>
	<li class="p1">Screw fear. It has held me back too long.</li>
	<li class="p1">Work smarter, not harder.<del>Personal productivity. Squeeze as much out of each hour as possible.</del></li>
	<li class="p1">Be open to new opportunities that allow me to pursue this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reality-check</h2>
There are fail-safes that are in place here though. Pursuing the extremeties of becoming an outlier requires sacrifice, and it's up to me to <a href="https://medium.com/@housecor/the-illogical-allure-of-extremes-509254c6fefb">figure out the cost and pay it</a>.
<h3>Family first</h3>
The family has always, and will always come first.
<h3>Considerate over ego-centric</h3>
Focusing on becoming an outlier requires focusing and pushing your priorities. There may come times when this directly conflicts with a team-effort / other individuals. I am very much about the team and that creating wonderful products is better when there's a team behind it.
<h3>Health</h3>
Ever since <a href="2015/11/09/how-are-you-really/">my burnout</a> I have completely lost focus on what I eat, and my running. These 4 months have been devastating to my physical health. I know that to obtain these mental and life-goals, my body needs to join the ride. Also, given the allergies and health conditions in our household, this is a necessity. If you're interested you can read about <a href="http://enbedrehverdag.com">part of our journey here</a> (norwegian).

I am a running geek, and have loved running competitions, hoping to push limits to marathon. This is going to be bumped down to regular runs to keep my health in check. Maybe I can combine it with some cross-fit. We'll see what fits.

I will focus on personal development through mindfulness and possibly meditation.

Sleep. Nothing more needs saying.
<h3>Friends &amp; Hobbies</h3>
I'll be doing some heavy pruning of my twitter followings and facebook friends. Twitter is pretty clean, since I follow some well-defined lists mostly. Facebook on the other hand  is a mess of friends &amp; acquaintences close and far.

Playing football, running competitions (10k &amp; half-marathons) and playing games are going to be sacrificed.

I will try to make the occasional road-trip to visit friends. Most happen to live 2-hours away. So I can let the wife drive and I can cram in some outlier time on the road.
<h2>Rounding up</h2>
I want to live my (professional) life to its fullest potential. But instead of <a href="/2009/05/03/my-road-to-becoming-a-better-developer/">aimlessly</a> jumping on the next round life deals out to me, I want to have the opportunity and possibility to decide when my hand gets dealt. Or at least have a card or two up my sleeve.

So here's to <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/">stop sucking, and being awesome</a>! I hope you'll join me on this journey.
