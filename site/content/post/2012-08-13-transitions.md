As some of you may know, I've left the domain of scandinavian e-commerce and am no longer part of the <a href="http://komplettdev.wordpress.com/">web-team at Komplett Group</a>.

My time at Komplett has been quite a ride; I've met some extremely skilled people, and worked on some <a href="http://pavsaund.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/bifrost-a-little-background/">really exciting stuff</a>. Contrary to what some people might believe, the web-team is small and covers a lot of area. There was a lot of responsibilty and pressure, but also a lot of fun to be had. This has also allowed me to delve into several areas of software development that I couldn't have on a larger team.

I now find myself neck deep within media / brodcasting production. To be more clear, I'm now part of the department for New Media at the <a href="http://www.nrk.no">Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (NRK Nye Medier). Quite a large leap from e-commerce, but at the end of the day it's all about delivering business value to the customer(s), and that's something I'm getting the hang of :).

I've now started my commute to Oslo on a daily basis, and the team has welcomed me with open arms. They all seem thrilled to have me on board. It's a good feeling, and I hope to find my role here, as I did at Komplett.

I like to think that it's at Komplett I "found myself" as a developer. I'm looking forward to continue building upon my skills and continue my journey at NRK... :)
