title: Moving the blog

I've just moved the blog from the free <a href="http://pavsaund.wordpress.com" target="_blank">wordpress.com</a> site to a hosted vps-variant&nbsp;on <a href="http://pavsaund.com" target="_blank">pavsaund.com</a>. I see there are some visual differences in the theme, but I think most of the content has been moved as expected.

Please do let me&nbsp;know if there's anything that doesn't seem to be working.&nbsp;

Need to figure out if there's a way to set up a permanent redirect 301 from the old blog. I see that there's a <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/site-redirect/">paid service</a>, but I don't really have a lot of traffic. Please do shout out if you have any tips on this.
