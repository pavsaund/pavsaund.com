Anxiety is a strong and negative feeling. Feeling overwhelmed. Stressed. Or just a general sense of nervousness. Well, we all feel this on some level or the other. The protective father, the nervous traveler or even the developer with a deadline closing in.

When putting things into perspective, anxiety is often a result of caring too much about things that are outside your control. When the protective father wants to protect his child from the dangers of the world, well, then he'll need to be there ALL the time (and then some!).

Instead, look at what you actually <strong>do </strong>control. Focus on where you can put your efforts to make the bigger picture look a lot less scary. Know that you are doing what you can with yourself, so when something does happen, you'll be ready.

It's also a source of procrastination. It's a  numbing feeling that will not only fear for something, but also make sure you are going to fail. Unless you take measures to actively put your anxiety into perspective.
