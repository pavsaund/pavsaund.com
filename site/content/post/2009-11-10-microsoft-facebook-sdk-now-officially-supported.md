The team <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=334" target="_blank">recently announced</a> this on their dev-blog, which is great news for all .NET developers wanting to develop applications against the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Platform</a>.
<blockquote>..This SDK contains rich social features and offers something for almost any kind of Facebook developer who is building with Microsoft technology, whether you're implementing Facebook Connect or are building a Web-based or desktop application...</blockquote>
Microsoft has also supplied a great <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ee388574.aspx" target="_blank">SDK Overview</a> that will get you started with facebook development in technologies like Silverlight, WinForms, WebForms /ASP.Net, ASP.Net MVC.
