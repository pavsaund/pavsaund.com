I've considered getting my own personal blog going for some time now (read: years...) , but haven't really taken the time. Now that I've finally got one up and running, I realize that i haven't really considered what to fill it with!

So, will this be just another blog with updates every 2-3 months, or a one with interesting content that enthrill and inspire?

..I don't really know. One thing is for sure though, it's <em><strong>a place for me to be me..</strong></em>
