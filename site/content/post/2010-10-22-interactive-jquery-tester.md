<h1>Interactive jQuery tester</h1>
I dug this link up the other day, and thought I'd spread the love :)

If you've ever had debugging issues with your jQuery selectors. Or would like to experiment a bit then the <a title="Interactive jQuery tester" href="http://www.woods.iki.fi/interactive-jquery-tester.html" target="_blank">Interactive jQuery tester</a> is a great solution. You paste your HTML, then type in the selectors. The elements that are actually selected are then highlighted, which gives instant feedback.

Hope you find this as useful as Â I have in the past.
