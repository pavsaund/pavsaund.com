As part of my <a href="http:///2016/01/03/being-awesome/">quest to be exceptional</a>, I've been searching to discover what I'm passionate about as a software developer. I feel a pull in so many directions, but I guess that's natural given our profession and the diversity we're exposed to.

Some people have found their calling and are producing wonderful content that provides tremendous value to others. What I've been wanting to do is figure out what my special sauce is. What is that I can bring to the table that can provide some value to others and at the same time not drown out in all the noise?

Well, you're here and you've read the title, so you may have guessed it already: <strong>Empathy</strong>

I am no&nbsp;sort of expert on this, but I find myself fascinated and attracted to the concept of infusing empathy into all aspects of software development. I care about my craft, and I care about boosting my career. But even more I care about doing so with a softer approach than what is out there already. I hope to create a site with an empathic view to the challenges new and experienced software developers face.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any ideas / thoughts / recommendations on this topic. I would also like to hear from any of you that don't see value in a site like this.

So I'd like to welcome you to an empathic journey:&nbsp;<a href="http://codingwithempathy.com" target="_blank">http://codingwithempathy.com</a>
