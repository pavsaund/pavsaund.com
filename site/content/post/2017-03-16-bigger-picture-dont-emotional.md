title: The Bigger Picture - Don't be so emotional!

Emotions tend to take over your day to day life.Â You experience high's and low's. This could be at work, at home, with your friends or maybe even all of the time?

Would you accept if another person pushed you around the same way you allow your emotions to push you around?

How about putting things into perspective. Looking at the big picture and realising that your emotions in this point of time is just a grain of sand compared to your life.

<strong>It's not the end of the world.</strong>
