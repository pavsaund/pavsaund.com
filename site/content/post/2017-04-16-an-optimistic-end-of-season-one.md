title: An optimistic end of season one

After a rather abrupt ending to the vlog, I finally came around to summarising some of the key stoic learnings from these first 30 episodes.

It's also a slighty better ending, to what I'm dubbing "Season one", than...nothing.

It's with an immense sense of optimism that I give you this final episode of Season One. Thank you toÂ everyone who has subscribed, watched, shared, liked and commented on any of the episodes. Your support has been wonderful and I'm looking forward to Season two!
