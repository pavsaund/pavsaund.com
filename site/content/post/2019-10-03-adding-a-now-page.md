TL;DR: I've written and published a [/now page](/now). 

For more of the back story and understanding what it is, read on.

I can't remember when I first stumbled over Derek Sivers. It could have been one of his posts on [giving away all his money](https://sivers.org/trust), or perhaps his [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement) on [leadership lessons from a dancing guy](https://sivers.org/ff). Regardless, at one point in time I remember reading about [the concept of a now page](https://sivers.org/nowff). I found it intriguing, but never really got around to it.

**What is a Now Page?**

The concept is quite straight forward. It's not an "about page", nor is it a "contact page". It's a page describing what's going on in your life right now. 

> Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

**But why even have a Now page?** 

This sums it up well:

> It’s useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site: because people on your site want to know more about you.
>
> Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.

## The time is Now

For some reason, the story of the first follower has stuck with me. It's powerful when another person echoes your voice, or if you choose to echo another's. It seems the effects of being that first follower can have long-tail impact. I realised while re-reading Derek's original now-post that his first follower was [Gregory Brown](https://practicingdeveloper.com/now/), a person who [has been influential](https://codingwithempathy.com/2016/12/27/reflecting-on-2016/) on my journey. 

It's taken me a few years, but the time has finally come to put up my [Now-page](/now). Perhaps a little too much overlap to an about page - but I suppose it will evolve.
