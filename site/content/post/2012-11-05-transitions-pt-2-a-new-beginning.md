title: Transitions pt.2 - a new beginning

This post is signalling an end to my time at Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), even though it's just a few months since I <a title="Transitions" href="http://pavsaund.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/transitions/">announced my career-move</a> there. Before I go on about whats happening, I'd like to emphasise that NRK is a great place to be. I've met a lot of talented people and been exposed to a company culture that oozes of professionalism and encourages peoples creativity to flow.

That said, I've been given the opportunity to release the entrepreneur in me, and be part of creating something. During my time at Komplett, we created <a title="Bifrost at github" href="https://github.com/dolittle/Bifrost">Bifrost</a>, an open-sourced platform for application development. A bi-product of our efforts was a mindset towards application development and collaboration between team members that we found to be unique. Which is what has lead myself and <a title="Einar Ingebrigtsen's playground" href="http://ingebrigtsen.info">Einar Ingebrigtsen</a> to establish <a href="http://www.dolittle.com">dolittle</a> as a knowledge company.

We believe that writing code isn't meant to be hard. It's all about asking the right questions and getting the right answers in any given problem-domain. We believe Bifrost is part of the solution, allowing development teams to focus on the right problem; namely creating software that solves the needs of the end-user and the business.

Needless to say I'm excited about things moving forward, we see great potential in what we're focusing on, and we'll be keeping things up to date on the <a title="dolittle blog" href="http://blog.dolittle.com">official dolittle blog</a>.

I'd like to thank the people at NRK for the opportunity, and I hope to meet them again some time in the future.
