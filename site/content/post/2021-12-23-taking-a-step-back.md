When revisiting some old cold I wrote I had the opportunity to see how some of my decisions forced others down a ceratin path. How separating concerns had been done right and that the wrong level of abstractions were in place.

\- take a step back

\- identify clear boundaries / concerns

\- visualise what the end goal should be

\- acknowledge where you are

\- find the next step that will take you towards said end goal.

\- combine this with "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"

\- Baby steps
